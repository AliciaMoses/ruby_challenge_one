# Building a Password Validator

In this section, you'll we'll plan the password validator and then you'll  will build the password validator.

You must complete the password validator before moving on to section 10.

## Before You Begin

Do the drills for this chapter to get practice with each individual component before bringing everything together.

You must complete all the drills, before moving on to section 10.
## Requirements

The password validator will ensure that a password is compliant with the following rules.

- It must be longer than 7 characters (8 is fine)
- It must contain at least one of the following special characters: `!`, `@`, `$`, `%` or `&`

If the password is valid, the program should return true.  If the password is invalid, the program should return false.

## Learning Objectives

In this section, you will
- Learn about problem decomposition
- Revisit concepts from previous sections
- Bring those concepts together to make a small program

## Problem Decomposition

It's absolutely critical that you get good at problem decomposition if you want to succeed as a software developer. Simply put, it is the process of breaking down large complex problems into small problems that are easy to solve. If you don't do this, you will eventually get really stuck but if you do it, and do it well, you will be able to build **anything**.

Let's do some problem decomposition, first of all with a non-programming problem – moving house!

Moving house is a complex and stressful problem that can be broken down into very many simpler problems, or tasks. For example...

1. Get lots and lots of boxes
2. Pack your stuff into the boxes
3. Pack the boxes into the van you hired
4. Drive the van to your new home
5. Unpack the boxes from the van
6. Unpack your stuff from the boxes

Each of these can be further broken down...

1. Get lots and lots of boxes
- Get some boxes from Tesco
- Get some boxes from Asda
- Get some boxes from that shop on the corner whose name your forgot
- Check if you have lots of boxes
- If you need more boxes, do all of this again tomorrow

Now let's break down the problem of creating a password validator program...

1. We'll need an `if` statement
2. There'll be one branch for checking length
3. There'll be one or more branches that check for the presence of special characters

## Getting Started

The information and the challenges themselves are in [this repo](https://github.com/makersacademy/ruby_foundations_quizzes).

Once you finish the challenges for Chapter 1, come here to reflect on your progress.

## Reflect and Review

Well done for completing the first drills and programming challenge!

**Please pause at this point to reflect and review your learning...**

- What did you find hard about the drills?
- What did you find hard about the programming challenge?
- What one thing would you like to learn more about?
