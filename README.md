# Basic Programming

## Learning objectives

<!-- OMITTED -->

In this section, you'll learn how to write programs using Ruby which will, necessarily, involve learning Ruby's syntax. Along the way, you'll also learn about [problem decomposition](link), [debugging](link) and [experimenting in IRB](link).

#### By the end of the module, you will be able to

- Execute Ruby code in two different ways
- Make a plan using problem decomposition and experimentation
- Describe and use variables
- Describe and use constants
- Describe and use conditionals
- Describe and use arrays
- Describe and use hashes
- Describe and use methods
- Describe and use classes
- Build programs using all of the above!

## Structure

There are 3 chapters to work through. The first chapter introduces a range of new concepts and which are built upon, and added to, as you progress through the other chapters. This process of introducing something and then revisiting it later on is called "spiralling" – you can read about it [here](./pills/spiralling.md), if you're curious.

As you progress you'll be given challenges at several points, which you must complete before moving on. There are two types of challenge - _drills_ and _programs_.

### Drills

These challenges are really tightly focused and repetitive. The goal is to become familiar with the basic building blocks of programming.
### Programs

These challenges require you to bring those basic building blocks together and build a useful program.
