# These exercises require you to define methods
# Most methods will take an array or hash as an argument
# Some methods will take other args
# Some methods won't take any args

# You won't find everything that you need in our materials
# Use the Ruby Docs and Google liberally if you get stuck

# Over to you!

## Arrays

# first_element
# takes one array as an arg
# returns the first element

# second_element
# takes one array as an arg
# returns the second element

# last_element
# takes one array as an arg
# returns the last element

# first_two_elements
# takes one array as an arg
# returns the first two elements

# first_three_elements
# takes one array as an arg
# returns the first three elements

# total
# takes one array of numbers as an arg
# adds all the numbers together
# returns the total

# lowest_number
# takes one array of numbers as an arg
# returns the lowest value

# highest_number
# takes one array of numbers as an arg
# returns the highest value

# the_beatles
# takes no args
# returns ['john', 'paul', 'george', 'ringo']

# i_joined_the_beatles
# takes one string as an arg
# when that string is 'freda' (for example)
# returns ['john', 'paul', 'george', 'ringo', 'freda']

# we_joined_the_beatles
# takes one array as an arg
# when the array is ['sam', 'alex'] (for example)
# returns ['john', 'paul', 'george', 'ringo', 'sam', 'alex']

# remove_nils_from_array
# takes one array as an arg
# returns the array, minus any nils

# double_array
# takes one array as an arg
# when that array is [1,2,3]
# returns [1,2,3,1,2,3]

# unique_elements
# takes one array as an arg
# when that array is [1,1,2,2,3,3]
# returns [1,2,3]

# add_to_array
# takes one array and one string as args
# adds the string to the array
# returns the new array

## Hashes

# new_band_member
# takes a hash of one key-value pair as an arg
# merges it wth the existing hash of band members
# returns the new hash
# the existing band members are: {'vocalist' => 'miss piggy', 'lead_guitar' => 'scooter'
# if the arg is {'drummer' => 'kermit'}
# returns {'vocalist' => 'miss piggy', 'lead_guitar' => 'scooter', 'drummer' => 'kermit'}

# all_values
# takes one hash as an arg
# returns the values

# all_keys
# takes one hash as an arg
# returns the keys

# remove_nils_from_hash
# takes one hash an an arg
# removes key-value pairs where the value is nil
# returns the remaining key-value pairs as a hash

# key_value_swap
# takes one hash as an arg
# swaps the keys with the values
# returns the new hash

# touch_in
# takes two args
# arg one: the name of a tube station e.g. 'Aldgate East'
# arg two: a date and time e.g. '2022/01/30 17:12'
# returns a hash with key-value pairs for 'entrypoint' and 'time'
