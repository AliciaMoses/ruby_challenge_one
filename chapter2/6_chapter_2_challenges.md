# Password Manager

In this chapter we covered everything you need in order to build the password manager. Now it's time to put everything into practice.

## Before You Begin

Do the drills for this chapter to get practice with each individual component before bringing everything together.
## Requirements

The password manager will need to:
- Allow you add new, validated, passwords
- Allow you to view a specific password
- Allow you to see a list of all the services for which a password has been stored

## Problem Decomposition

- You're going to need three methods:
  - `add_password`, which is used to add a new password
  - `password_for`, which returns the password for a given service
  - `all_services`, which returns a list of all the services for which a password has been stored
- The passwords will be stored in hash, where the key is the service and the value is the password
- This hash will need to be stored in an instance variable

## Getting Started

The information and the challenges themselves are in [this repo](https://github.com/makersacademy/ruby_foundations_quizzes).

Once you finish the challenges for Chapter 2, come here to reflect on your progress.

## Reflect and Review

Well done for completing the Chapter 2 challenges!

**Please pause at this point to reflect and review your learning...**

- What did you find hard about the drills?
- What did you find hard about the programming challenge?
- What one thing would you like to learn more about?
