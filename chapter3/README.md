## The Big Picture

Password Manager is great but it lacks a few really useful features. The next iteration, Password Manager 2.0, will allow users to...

- Delete services (and their passwords)
- Track when a password was added
- Update passwords
- Track when a password was updated
- Ensure all service names are unique
- Ensure all passwords are unique
- Sort the list of services alphabetically and by date of password creation
