# Building Password Manager 2.0

You now know all that you need in order to build Password Manager 2.0

## Requirements

Here's a reminder of the new requirements.

Password Manager 2.0, will allow users to...

- Delete services (and their passwords)
- Track when a password was added
- Update passwords
- Track when a password was updated
- Ensure all service names are unique
- Ensure all passwords are unique
- Sort the list of services alphabetically and by date of password creation

## Problem Decomposition

You're going to need 6 methods this time
- `add`  adds a service and its password
- `remove` deletes a service and its password
- `services` returns a list of all services
- `sort_by` sorts by service name or date added
- `password_for` returns the password for a specific service
- `update` updates the password for a specific service

To improve readability, you might choose to break some of these methods down into small pieces by implementing your own, additional, methods.
## Getting Started
