# Problem Decomposition

Problem decomposition is the process of breaking a large, complex, problem down into more manageable sub-problems. The motivating principle is that large problems are disproportionately hard to solve – i.e. the total effort required to solve all the sub-problems is going to be less than would be required for the larger problem.

It should be one of the first things you do, when taking on any programming challenge.

## Practicing Problem Decomposition

You can practice problem decomposition with any problem. Try it now, using your own example or the ones below.

## Organising a Social Event

Imagine that you're organising a BBQ. It's a complex task with many things to think about, especially if you want company!

Break this task down into sub-tasks and then take one sub-task and break it down further. See how far you can go.

## Sorting a Deck of Cards

Imagine that you're giving instructions to another person how to do this. They have the deck of cards spread out in front of them, face down, and they're only allowed to have two cards flipped at any one time.

If you can break this down into steps, you'll probably then be able to translate your steps into code, but I would advise you to use numbers rather than cards :)

## Moving House

Apparently, one of the most stressful life events, it's certainly a complex task! There's the initial search, arrangements to move out of one place, arrangements to move into the new place, a ton of admin and much more.

Break this task down into sub-tasks and then take one sub-task and break it down further. See how far you can go.

## Checking for Duplicates

Once again, imagine you're giving instructions to another person. This time their task is to check for duplicates in a deck of cards – perhaps someone is suspected of cheating?

Again, the deck of cards is in front of them, spread out face down, and they can only have two cards flipped at any one time.

If you can break this down into steps, you'll probably then be able to translate your steps into code, but I would advise you to use numbers rather than cards :)

## Get Feedback

To get feedback on one of the card related problems, use your solution to direct someone else in performing the task. Note that they can only do exactly what you've written.
